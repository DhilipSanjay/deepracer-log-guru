# Special Mouse and Keyboard Actions

## Track Zoom In

Whenever DRG is showing the track, whatever the analysis mode, click and hold the **left mouse button** and drag a rectangle where you wish to zoom in.

_Hint: To zoom back out to the complete track, especially if you get "lost" by zooming in too much, click on the menu option **Zoom** -> **Zoom - In/Out**_

## Drilldown

Many (but not all) DRG analsis modes offer a "drilldown" interaction using either of the following, whichever you find most convenient:
* Right mouse button single click
* Left mouse button double click

The exact meaning of the "drilldown" is as follows:
* Analyze -> Episode Route ... display the "Detailed Event Info" window for the event/step that is closest to the mouse click

Analyze -> Episode Route
  "Previous Event" = Left or down arrow key (hold it down to rapidly move backwards through multiple steps)
  "Next Event" = Right or Up arrow key (hold it down to rapidly move forwards through multiple steps)
