Essential Before Tentative v3 Release
=====================================

+ Minimal fixes for analyse race - certainly ensure that selecting a new filter or different file etc. does a "reset"
+ Flag it as a new/prototype feature in UI

Fix this bug:
Display ROUTE log info, then go to different analysis and change the episode selector << or >> (log info should close), and return to ROUTE circle highlight is still there!!

Finish some docs especially:
+ Rewrite the proposed simpler installation documentation (remember no clunky setting of log dir now ...)
+ Refresh the sales "collage" and provide a new "Gallery" of images instead ..... ?
( NB some docs like terminology & key/mouse can wait until 3.0.1 but installation instructions are essential doh ... )


v3.0.1 Improvements
===================

+ Median lap time should be added to the quarterly view
+ Lap time distribution should be able to show how it evolves per quarter

+ Migrate all heatmap/routes to the new approach used for steering straight/left/right
+ Extensive re-testing ... NB heatmap for single episode should give same colours, or very similar, as episode route)

+ Heatmap colours may sometimes be based on PERCENTILEs - esp. for rewards  (or performance-efficient compromise)

+ Heatmap issues (a) tune visit based inclusion, especially when starts are shown - eliminates too much stuff??
                 (b) try a shorter start exclusion - and in any case, move its config into the personalize area

+ Move sector definitions into new personalization area (same approach as for track annotations)

+ Finish testing new reward function integration
+ Test with complicated DRF style reward functions too

+ Finish simple re-org of config in the "personalize" package instead ...

+ professionalise and standardize remaining (graph) colours to match excellent quality of new heatmaps

+ pressing a button when screen is already drawing does not redraw but does still press the button - VERY ODD BUG FOR THE USER

Fix old bugs:
45-BUG  *** Don't show the final iteration, if incomplete, in certain training stats and similar  [ noting that AWS console may include incomplete EVALUATION runs, but not an incomplete training ]

+ Test a lot, comparing where possible with v2.0.5 for regression issues
+ (to help with this, consider .. )Grab best sample logs per track & per best model into one place in clear dir. structure


Brand New Analysis Views
======================
Newest idea - ability to show relationship between reward and characteristics like speed and pos from centre - 1D and 2D (coloured)
Detailed drilldown into "outcomes" at a particular waypoint - esp. graphs to show outcome of different positions (e.g. success % beyond point)
Track-only view - with facilities like measuring distance between points, inside versus outside distance, ability to draw and measure a path etc.
Curve fitting - as special feature of track-only view?
Best possible lap time predictor - by piecing together fastest sections
Time Animations of esp. lap time distribution or action distribution

Existing Analysis Enhancements
=============================
(lap) time correlation with certain actions (e.g. percent of actions that are in the filter, see also +++)
Offer reward correlations without final reward included in total?...
Add waypoint numbers (every 10?) to track views (optional)
Exit points:
    + show last second or similar as a line (alternative to dots)
    + ability to show evaluation exit waypoints too
Training/Learning stats - eliminate incomplete final iteration (if actually incomplete)
                        - offer additional optional plotting of estimated lap time
Episode slide is not finished - should have same/similar filters as for episode speed, reward & so on
Ability to flag favourite episodes (****)   OR ALLOW USER TO "TAG" EPISODES (and then quote a TAG as a filter criteria)
Quarterly progress - add speed indications e.g. median lap time in particular (i.e. to answer broadly was it getting faster or not?)
Curve fitting - go beyond quadratic for more advanced curves with 2 or 3 inflexions ....
Quarterly progress - make sure Q really are now as even as possible + decide if/how to eliminate a final iteration if not complete
Show colourmap key for heatmap & route analysis
Ability to stipulate that sector times (esp. for correlation) must have a survival period before and/or after ... (i.e. skip slow starts, and risky finishes)
Maximise space around graphs (see how quarterly view did it)
Colour-code quarterly progress to see at a glance if learning or not - and then can add a LOT of new indicators - like a true dashboard...
Enhance action space analysis to show distribution within each sector (multiple graphs on screen at same time ...)
Perhaps use caching to speed up repeated flicking between heatmap options
Race might be able to move bots (would need to be for ONE episode only ... )?

Filters
=======
Find sequences +++
More quick-choice options for action filtering?? (esp. turning rather than speed)
Enhance "sector" with DIY "section" capability too ... with ability to set a section using mouse markers (drag and drop start and finish markers), as well entering waypoint numbers
Enhance episode section/sector filtering for additional characteristics of the section e.g. min/max reward etc.
Ability to filter episode for entire total score (with or without last step)

+++ Remembering to add these to all relevant analysis views as new choices etc.

Special Features
================
Make graphs interactive - esp. (a) see the data at a point   (b) "goto" that point (e.g. switch to that episode etc.)
Ability to join several files together as a single set of episodes for analysis
Larger text option - for better screen video capture ...
Add quick keys for all major / most useful menu options
Ability to calculate "safe distance ahead" and "visible distance ahead" and hence offer as options for episode route INFO and as a COLOUR SCHEME


Minor bugs & fixes etc
======================
Lap time estimate should account for start-up time in first 1 or 2 seconds ...
Show training start point more clearly as different shape (e.g. diamond)
Ability to include waypoint numbers as part of waypoint view options

Code Quality etc.
=================
Implement standards
Add unit tests!!!
Standardize graph colours as constants (esp. the C1, C2 etc.)
Switch meta file format to JSON    (see new user config file as prototype for JSON approach)

Documentation
=============

YouTube videos
Announce V3 "loudly"
Terminology reference
Keyboard reference
Help screens from within GUI (including terminology)
Markup screenshot collage with comment that Google can find and index
List of features (primarily as marketing material)

===================



47-ENH  Load seems to be (disappointingly) slow - check if extra analysis on load is slowing it down
46-ENH  Special search facility to find correlations between observations and results  [search all waypoints or short sections to see if certain actions, positions, speed or bearing have a clear correlation with either progress % or overall lap time]
45-BUG  *** Don't show the final iteration, if incomplete, in certain training stats and similar  [ noting that AWS console may include incomplete EVALUATION runs, but not an incomplete training ]
44-ENH  Reproduce the same reward graph as AWS Console   [does mean EXACTLY, or perhaps only able to chose console or DRG colours?]
43-ENH  Provide simple dialog view of key stats for a track e.g. exact length, inside and outside lengths etc.
40-ENH  Event selection as per route analysis should be "shared" with other route analysis (e.g. speed)   [for example, on speed analysis, the action dot can be highlighted, and also the same arrow keys can be used to navigate backwards or forwards along the actions/steps]
36-ENH  Add shortcut keys for menu options - especially analysis views and common filters
35-ENH  Provide quick switch buttons between useful/related analysis views (more convenient than menus)
32-ENH  Ability to increase text size of menus and frame-based controls etc. (for better YouTube reproduction)
31-ENH  Ability to see more stats and info across multiple files (esp. the training hyper parameters)  [export button would be nice] [ main thing is to be able to see/review how I tinkered with the hyper parameters (coupled with a reminder of the defaults - so easy to see what changed, and by how much]
22-ENH  Add ability to chose favourite episodes   [ideally keep a record in meta file for next time...]
19-ENH  Optimize performance & check button response in "convergence" analysis  [CONTAINS A HOST OF ISSUES AND IDEAS ...]
17-ENH  Add filtered/all option to ALL analysis screens, including episode route [Think again about whether applying all/filtered option to the "video" controls is viable]
15-DOC  Provide help / demo videos on YouTube
14-ENH  Provide "goto" episode
13-ENH  Provide link to episode on charts like lap time correlation [e.g. click on the plotted dot and it takes you to route analysis]
12-ENH  Annotate waypoint charts with track features like left, right, straight, hairpin etc. [perhaps also show in episode graphs so user can recognize positions]
 8-DOC  Provide help / documentation - help menu and info/help icons on the screen
 7-DOC  Document terminology  [User reported things like "filtered" and also especially the different colour schemes for the episode route analysis]
 5-ENH  Log event info changes width with each event [improved now except for minor jitter - don't fix yet]
