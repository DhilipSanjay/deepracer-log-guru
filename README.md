## Introduction

Deep Racer Guru (DRG) is an interactive detailed analysis tool for AWS Deep Racer logs.

Its main purpose is to provide "out-of-the-box" analysis that can run locally on your own computer.

You don't have to write Python code. Simply download logs from the AWS Deep Racer console, and then use a GUI to see how your models are performing.
